# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor-
The aim of this project is to design a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor for RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor. 
The MIPS processor was designed  using MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and divided into two parts:  the datapath unit, 
and the control unit. Verilog HDL language to design hardware modling is used on ModelSim tool. 
Keywords: MIPS, RISC, ISA, datapath, Verilog.
